# <img src="assets/image/icon.jpg" width="5%" height="5%"> HyKeos

Bot designed for my server. But maybe some of the methods and commands will be useful for you to learn. *I took the image from a site that did not put the author, if anyone knows who it is do not hesitate to tell me.*

## Requirements

To get started, you'll need to configure Hykeos with your bot token and server ID. You have two options for setting these values: using a config.json file or setting them as environment variables.

### Using Environment Variables

```txt
TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>
ID_GUIRIS=<SERVER_ID>
```

### Using config.json

Create a config.json file in the root directory of your project and add your bot token and server ID as shown below:

```json
{
   "TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>",
   "ID_GUIRIS": "<SERVER_ID>"
}
```

Replace <YOUR_TOKEN> with your bot's token and <SERVER_ID> with your server's ID.

## Dependencies

Create a virtual environment using:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
```

Enter it and install dependencies with

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Additionally, and I don't really know why, install pycord separatelly by using:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord
```

or

```sh
pip install py-cord
```

### PyCord

- [Pycord documentation](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/index.html)
- [Pycord introduction guide](https://guide.pycord.dev/introduction)

## Installation & config in Docker

The next steps are to configure the bot with a docker, and set it up as a service.

### Build docker image

Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile for Hykeos and run the following command to build the Docker image

```sh
docker build -t hykeos .
```

### Create a systemd Service

Create a new systemd service file for Hykeos to ensure it starts automatically on boot by editing `/etc/systemd/system/hykeos.service`. Add the following content to the file:

```toml
[Unit]
Description=Hykeos Bot Docker Container
Requires=docker.service
After=docker.service

[Service]
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker start -a hykeos
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker stop -t 2 hykeos

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Enable and Start the Service

Enable the Hykeos service to start automatically on boot and start the service.

```sh
sudo systemctl enable hykeos.service
```

## Usage

Use `systemctl` `start`, `stop` and `status` to check the Hykeos service
